## 📝 Daily Learning Log

### Day 1 - Dataset Handling & EDA ✅
**Date**: August 8, 2025  
**Focus**: Exploratory Data Analysis

**Skills Practiced**:
- Pandas data loading and inspection
- Missing data pattern analysis
- Statistical visualization with seaborn
- Correlation analysis
- Feature relationship exploration

**Key Insights Learned**:
- Gender is the strongest predictor of survival (74.2% vs 18.9%)
- Passenger class significantly affects survival rates
- Family size has optimal ranges for survival
- Missing data patterns inform cleaning strategies

**Code Patterns Mastered**:
```python
# Data loading and inspection
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
df.info()
df.describe()

# Missing data visualization
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), ...)

# Statistical plotting
sns.countplot(data=df, x='feature', hue='target')
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='target', y='numerical_feature')

# Correlation analysis
df.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True)
```

**Next Day Preparation**:
