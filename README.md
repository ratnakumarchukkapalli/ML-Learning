## üîç Dataset Information

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic and whether they survived the disaster. This is a classic binary classification problem where we predict survival (1) or death (0) based on passenger characteristics.

**Features include:**
- Passenger class, gender, age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Fare paid, port of embarkation
- And more...

## üöÄ Next Steps After Completing the Notebook

1. **Try Different Algorithms**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Neural Networks

2. **Advanced Techniques**
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Cross-validation
   - Ensemble methods

3. **Real-World Projects**
   - Housing price prediction
   - Customer churn analysis
   - Image classification

4. **Deep Learning**
   - Neural networks with TensorFlow/PyTorch
   - Computer vision
   - Natural language processing

## üí° Tips for Learning
